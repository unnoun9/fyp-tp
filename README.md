# Formal Verification And Theorem Proving

This repository contains relevant code, tasks we were given, notes, and other things we encountered in the journey of formal verification and theorem proving for our super amazing and lovely FYP.

`efforts_cascade` and `efforts_unnoun` directories contain the relevant code (mostly Lean), tasks, Lean game's progress, and other things done by cascade and unnoun respectively.

`Notes` directories contains some notes for the sake of memory or documentation. To read the notes, a markdown reader/renderer is recommended. Clone the repository and just open your preferred markdown reader in that directory. For Obsidian (which we used here), open the *vault* in this *Notes* directory.
