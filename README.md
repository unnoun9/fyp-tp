# Notes

These are just notes to remember things learned in da journey of learning.

To read the notes, a markdown reader/renderer is recommended. Notes are present in the *Notes* directory, *who would've thought*... Clone the repository and just open your preferred markdown reader in that directory. For Obsidian, open the *vault* in this *Notes* directory.
