# Formal Verification And Theorem Proving

This repository contains code, notes, documentation, and other things we encountered in the journey of formal verification and theorem proving.

To read the notes, a markdown reader/renderer is recommended. Notes are present in the *Notes* directory... Clone the repository and just open your preferred markdown reader in that directory. For Obsidian, open the *vault* in this *Notes* directory. The *Misc* folder contains things that are not notes for now, such as code, progress data, etc.
